For cyclic references, a Garbage Collector is used. A crucial limitation is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This mutex protects data thread-safety but restricts parallel execution of bytecode across different threads. To circumvent this in heavy tasks, we use the multiprocessing module or asynchrony.",

A state machine (**FSM**) with a **Redis** storage was also implemented, allowing administrators to configure giveaways step-by-step (uploading media, selecting a date, setting conditions) without losing progress even during a server reboot.

I used asynchrony to implement **multi-accounting** — the bot can work with different Telegram sessions simultaneously without interference. Using `asyncio.gather()`, I configured parallel subscription checks in 5-10 channels at once. This reduced the user's waiting time from several seconds to milliseconds. Asynchronous queues (Tasks) also ensured stable background mailings that don't slow down the main bot interface during active giveaways."
